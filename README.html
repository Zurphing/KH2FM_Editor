<h1>KH2FM Editor</h1>

<p>Made by: Osdanova</p>
<p>V. 0.2</p>
<p>* Version Content:</p>
<p>This is a pre-release version. It contains many bugs (It'll crash easily)<br>
The main purpose of this release is to share with people the tool in order to study the various files of the game, using it as a viewer and hot testing field changes.<br>
As such, play around with the files and report anything you discover at OpenKH's Discord server. Sharing is caring :)<br>
That being said, feel free to use this tool for making your own mods.<br>
Be aware that this version hasn't been tested, so many functions may not work or may cause the tool to crash.<br>
Let me repeat just in case, this is a HEAVILY UNPOLISHED version. It will crash, buttons won't work and old pages will appear. (I don't know how to block that)<br>
Lastly, I have no page for "Can't read this file", so if you double click something and a page doesn't open, the tool doesn't support it.</p>

<p>* Version 0.2 update:</p>
<p>Added support for more files. Fixed some errors.<br>

<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<h2>Will there be more versions?</h2>
<p>Hopefully I'll polish the tool more and make more releases, but this is taking really long and I have more things I want to do. (This is why I'm releasing this version)<br>
In the best case scenario, I'll polish the tool, make the github where I store the code public and then I'll just go help with OpenKH for future tools.</p>

<h2>HOW TO USE</h2>

<p>First, you need the extracted ISO.</p>
<p>Open the tool and drag your files in the left panel. You can also drag a folder and a treeview will show.</p>

<p>From here, you can open any supported file by double clicking. The supported files are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>00objentry.bin</li>
  <li>00battle.bin</li>
  <li>03system.bin</li>
  <li>mixdata.bar</li>
  <li>jiminy.bar</li>
  <li>ARD files</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the file, you may be able to directly edit a field (Note that some are non-writable translations of IDs)</p>
<p>You can Test your modifications in-game by using the TEST buttons.</p>
<p>Note that it will write the data on the offset written on "Test Offset". Default values are given on some files for an english patched ISO (Crazycatz's patch)</p>
<p>You can also Export the modified file using the "Export" button</p>
<p>ABOUT THE FILTER UTILITY: If you add a record to a table while filtering, make sure to click on Save current before unfiltering.</p>

<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<h2>TOOLS</h2>
<p>Pretty self explanatory. Use Inventory to edit your inventory and stats to edit your stats.</p>
<p>NOTE: Stats requires you to open the game first or it'll crash. (V0.1)</p>
<p>This is because it reads PCSX2's memory when it's open.</p>

<h2>LAST WORDS</h2>
<p>Sorry if this manual is bad, I don't have the will to work on a better one, this has been months in the making. (And it's not version 1.0, so deal with it >:C)</p>
<p>Also sorry if I forgot something for the manual. I'm sure you'll get the hang of it.</p>
<p>Big thanks to the community, specially to the people at OpenKH, who are always a great help.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
